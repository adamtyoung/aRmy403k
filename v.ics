DESCRIPTION:Marin Alsop first saw the legendary Leonard Bernstein when she

	use someone told her she couldn’t.” The Washington Post

DTSTAMP:20220208T165200Z

DESCRIPTION:A young\, electrifying Antonio Banderas plays the psychotic gay
	 super fan (Antonio) of homo-erotic film director Pablo (Eusebio Poncela) 
	in this wonderfully over-wrought black comic melodrama\, Almodóvar’s seven
	th feature. Pablo himself is pining for Juan\, too straight to reciprocate
	\, and also directing his trans sister Tina (Carmen Maura) on stage. There
	’s rampant sex and cocaine use\, incest\, jabs at the Catholic Church… It’
	s all Almodóvar’s movies in one\, you might say. A statement of kinky inte

DESCRIPTION:A pivotal film in Almodóvar’s development\, maybe the first of

	cadent high camp gloss which had come to characterize the films of the ear
	ly 90s (High Heels\; Kika). Marisa Paredes plays novelist Leo\, who writes
	 romantic best-sellers under pen name Amanda Gris but wants to be taken se
	riously in her own right\, and whose marriage is on the rocks. Smartly bal
	ancing melodrama and comedy\, this is one of the director’s most under-rat
	ed movies.
