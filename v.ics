DESCRIPTION:The most important film about race since I Am Not Your Negro\, 
	Who We Are is an eloquent\, passionate and revelatory reclamation of the h
	istory America sweeps under the carpet. This is the story of how white sup
	remacy and slavery underpins the disUnited States\, and\, equally damning\
	, a critique of how the tide for social justice has been betrayed by the r
	ich and the powerful. Former ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jeffery Robinson’s
	 argument is interwoven with archival footage\, interviews\, and his own s
	tory.
