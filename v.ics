SUMMARY:Tribute to Peter Bogdanovich: The Last Picture Show
DTSTAMP:20220125T235300Z
DTSTART:20220203T035000Z
DESCRIPTION:Bogdanovich’s second film was a triumph\, an adaptation of Larr
	y McMurtry’s novel about a small Texas town at the dawn of the 1950s. Teen
	agers Duane and Sonny (Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms) are best friends\
	, but the soul of the film is Ben Johnson’s Sam the Lion\, proprietor of t
	he local movie house\, and a father figure in the boy’s lives. Robert Surt
	ees’ dusty monochrome cinematography evokes a great yearning for a lost go
	lden age.

SUMMARY:Keep Rolling (Ann Hui\, Filmmaker)
DTSTAMP:20220125T235300Z
DTSTART:20220203T041000Z
DESCRIPTION:Recipient of Venice Film Festival’s 2020 Lifetime Achievement A
	ward\, Ann Hui’s 40-year artistic trajectory not only mirrors the roller-c
	oaster ride that is Hong Kong cinema\, but parallels the poignant yet resi
	lient course of its history. Hui displays her storytelling genius not only
	 with celluloid but in humourous\, candid conversation. This documentary s
	eamlessly weaves interviews and archival material into a Who’s Who of Asia
	n cinema\, and is catnip for cinephiles anywhere.

DESCRIPTION:Kenneth Branagh gets personal in this bittersweet black and whi
	te autobiographical drama\, set in his hometown in Northern Ireland in 196
	9\, at the advent of the Troubles. Buddy (Jude Hill) is nine when spiralin
	g Catholic unrest upsets his previously cozy childhood and sends shockwave
	s through his tight-knit family: Ma and Pa (Caitríona Balfe and Jamie Dorn
	an) and beloved grandparents (Judi Dench and Ciarán Hinds). For Buddy\, it
	’s a rude awakening\, but even hard times bring humour and vivid dreams of
	 escape.

DTSTAMP:20220125T235300Z
DTSTART:20220204T035000Z
DESCRIPTION:After the acclaim which greeted The Last Picture Show\, Bogdano
	vich proved his versatility with this colourful\, contemporary screwball c
	omedy inspired by Howard Hawks’ classic Bringing Up Baby. Ryan O’Neal stan
	ds in for Cary Grant\, and Barbra Streisand for Katharine Hepburn. Instead
	 of a paleontologist\, it’s the story of an absent-minded musicologist who
	se impending marriage to Madeline Kahn is derailed by the force of nature 
	that is Streisand’s disaster-prone Judy Maxwell.
