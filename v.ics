DTSTAMP:20220202T225900Z

DESCRIPTION:Bogdanovich’s second film was a triumph\, an adaptation of Larr
	y McMurtry’s novel about a small Texas town at the dawn of the 1950s. Teen
	agers Duane and Sonny (Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms) are best friends\
	, but the soul of the film is Ben Johnson’s Sam the Lion\, proprietor of t
	he local movie house\, and a father figure in the boy’s lives. Robert Surt
	ees’ dusty monochrome cinematography evokes a great yearning for a lost go
	lden age.

	eamlessly weaves interviews and archival material into a Who’s Who of Asia
