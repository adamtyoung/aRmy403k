SUMMARY:The Sleeping Negro
DTSTAMP:20220215T173400Z
DTSTART:20220216T041500Z
DESCRIPTION:"To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious i
	s to be in a state of rage almost all of the time." Beginning with a quote
	 from James Baldwin\, Skinner Myers’ radical debut feature is an uncomprom
	isingly confrontational movie\, a portrait of a young Black man (played by
	 Myers) on the verge of "making it": marriage (to a white woman) and big m
	oney career (his fiancee’s brother is his boss). But it feels all wrong. A
	lienated and angry\, he wavers between playing the game and tearing it all
	 down.

	in this wonderfully over-wrought black comic melodrama\, Almodóvar’s seven

	\, and also directing his trans sister Tina (Carmen Maura) on stage. There
	’s rampant sex and cocaine use\, incest\, jabs at the Catholic Church… It’

DESCRIPTION:A pivotal film in Almodóvar’s development\, maybe the first of 
	his "mature" works\, The Flower of My Secret dispenses with much of the de
	cadent high camp gloss which had come to characterize the films of the ear
	ly 90s (High Heels\; Kika). Marisa Paredes plays novelist Leo\, who writes
	 romantic best-sellers under pen name Amanda Gris but wants to be taken se
	riously in her own right\, and whose marriage is on the rocks. Smartly bal
	ancing melodrama and comedy\, this is one of the director’s most under-rat
	ed movies.
