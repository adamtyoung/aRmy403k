DESCRIPTION:The love child of Jean Cocteau and David Cronenberg\, this ugly

	er head and a chip on her shoulder. She’s also a killer hand with a metal-
	tipped chopstick. Oh\, and she’s carrying a baby which might very well be 
	born with four wheels and a motor. The film’s dream logic is aggressive bu
	t deliriously\, ecstatically demented. Did we mention it won the Palme d’O
	r?

SUMMARY:Tribute to Peter Bogdanovich: What's Up\, Doc?
DTSTAMP:20220128T232600Z
DTSTART:20220204T035000Z
DESCRIPTION:After the acclaim which greeted The Last Picture Show\, Bogdano
	vich proved his versatility with this colourful\, contemporary screwball c
	omedy inspired by Howard Hawks’ classic Bringing Up Baby. Ryan O’Neal stan
	ds in for Cary Grant\, and Barbra Streisand for Katharine Hepburn. Instead
	 of a paleontologist\, it’s the story of an absent-minded musicologist who
	se impending marriage to Madeline Kahn is derailed by the force of nature 
	that is Streisand’s disaster-prone Judy Maxwell.
